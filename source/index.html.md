# Introduction

Welcome to the WorkReduce API! You can use our API to access WorkReduce API endpoints, which can get information on various tasks and orders on our platform.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript!  As you scroll down the page, you will be able to view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

<aside class="notice">
The WorkReduce API is versioned by release date.  If you are just getting started, we recommend using the most recently released version of the API.  If you are using one of our libraries for Python, Ruby, or Node.js, this will be handled for you automatically.<br /><br />

If you are rolling your own connection via curl, you will need to ensure the URL endpoints contain the API release version you are using.<br /><br />

For example, requests to "https://api.workreduce.com/v2/orders" would go to version 2 of the API.
</aside>

API Version | Release date | Current Version?
--------- | ------- | -------
v2 | 07-05-2018 | **Yes**
v1 | 05-25-2018 | No





# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:


```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```


> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.



### Getting access to the API

WorkReduce uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can request access to the WorkReduce API by having a conversation with your Client Director, who will set you up with an API key.

### Authorizing your requests

WorkReduce expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in an HTTP header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your organization's API key.

# Order Lifecycle


### Diagram

Orders go through the following lifecycle with regards to their `status`:

<style>
.svg-img {
  padding-left: 50px;
}
.svg-img img {
  height: 600px;
  max-height: 600px;
}
</style>
<div class="svg-img">

  <img src="images/workreduce-request-lifecycle.svg" alt="Draft -> Activated -> Accepted -> In Progress -> Submitted -> In QA -> QA Complete -> Completed -> Delivered -> Approved">
</div>


### Values for Order `status` field

This endpoint retrieves all open orders for your account.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.workreduce.com/v2/orders`


### Pagination

The WorkReduce Get All Orders API route utilizes cursor-based pagination via the `starting_after` and `ending_before` parameters. Both parameters take an existing Order Number (see below) and return Orders in reverse chronological order. The `ending_before` parameter returns Orders listed before the named Order. The `starting_after` parameter returns Orders listed after the named Order. If both parameters are provided, only ending_before is used.


### URL Parameters

Parameter | Description | Additional Info
--------- | ----------- | -----------
status | Filter the result for Orders that match the status.  [See table with acceptable values for `status`](#order-status-values). | Optional.  Default behavior is not to filter.
limit | A limit on the number of Orders to be returned, between 1 and 100 | Optional. Default is 10.
starting_after | A cursor for use in pagination. starting_after is a WorkReduce Order Number that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include starting_after=obj_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list. | Optional
ending_before | A cursor for use in pagination. ending_before is a WorkReduce Order Number that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with obj_bar, your subsequent call can include ending_before=obj_bar in order to fetch the previous page of the list. | Optional
